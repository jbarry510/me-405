\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains a very simple A/\-D converter driver. The driver is hopefully thread safe in Free\-R\-T\-O\-S due to the use of a mutex to prevent its use by multiple tasks at the same time. There is no protection from priority inversion, however, except for the priority elevation in the mutex.

This overloaded operator \char`\"{}prints the A/\-D converter.\char`\"{}. 

Prints out the value of the A\-D\-C\-S\-R\-A, A\-D\-M\-U\-X registers, and a single reading of channels 0 through 7 of the A/\-D. 
\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em serpt} & Reference to a serial port to which the printout will be printed \\
\hline
{\em a2d} & Reference to the A/\-D driver which is being printed \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
A reference to the same serial device on which we write information. This is used to string together things to write with {\ttfamily $<$$<$} operators 
\end{DoxyReturn}
