 *    This file contains the @c main() code for a program which tests the ME405 board, 
 *    version 0.6.
 *
 *  Revisions:
 *    \li 09-30-2012 JRR Original file was a one-file demonstration with two tasks
 *    \li 10-05-2012 JRR Split into multiple files, one for each task plus a main one
 *    \li 10-30-2012 JRR A hopefully somewhat stable version with global queue 
 *                       pointers and the new operator used for most memory allocation
 *    \li 11-04-2012 JRR FreeRTOS Swoop demo program changed to a sweet test suite
