\subsection*{Classes}

\item 
class \hyperlink{classtask__brightness}{task\-\_\-brightness}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This task controls the brightness of an L\-E\-D using an analog input from the A/\-D converter. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}


\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file contains the header for a task class that controls the brightness of an L\-E\-D using a voltage measured from the A/\-D as input. The fun part\-: the brightness that is being controlled can be on another A\-V\-R computer, with signals being sent and received via wireless transceivers.

Revisions\-: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 09-\/30-\/2012 J\-R\-R Original file was a one-\/file demonstration with two tasks \item 10-\/05-\/2012 J\-R\-R Split into multiple files, one for each task \item 10-\/25-\/2012 J\-R\-R Changed to a more fully C++ version with class task\-\_\-sender \item 10-\/27-\/2012 J\-R\-R Altered from data sending task into L\-E\-D blinking class \item 11-\/04-\/2012 J\-R\-R Altered again into the multi-\/task monstrosity \item 12-\/13-\/2012 J\-R\-R Yet again transmogrified; now it controls L\-E\-D brightness\end{DoxyItemize}
